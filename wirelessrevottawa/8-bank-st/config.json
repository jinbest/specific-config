Unbelievably professional, knowledgeable technicians, and so polite, friendly, helpful. Once initial diagnostics had been performed, they called me right back to clearly explain the problems encountered and their suggested solution. You'll be blown away by their service, they're just that good. My computer is like brand new once again. Thanks guys.",
